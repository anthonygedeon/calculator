create a variable num1 
if num1 is empty it should add numbers to the num1 variable
if num1 has a number already and you press an operator it should add the operator to its own variable and start taking input for number 2
so essentially you'd have
num1 =
operator =
num2=
then you'd press some numbers and it would add them to num1 like this:
num1 = 1234 
then you'd press a operator and it would do this:
operator =  "+"
now it should just start taking numbers for num2
num2 = 1234
and at the end when you click the = sign it would store that and display it to the user
